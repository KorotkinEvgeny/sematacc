SEMAT Accelerator
=================

SEMAT Accelerator (a.k.a. SematAcc) is a web positioning system for [SEMAT](http://semat.org) Essence Theory of Software Engineering.

SematAcc provides practical ways to learn the Essence theory, as it enables a web positioning system to represent a software system status using Essence Kernel (currently, only the Alphas and the States are supported).

The tool itself serves for multiple use cases. In short, it is an awareness creator, self-positioning system, discussion generator as well as visualization of your project's current state.

The tool is a fully working prototype implemented using cutting-edge [Meteor](http://meteor.com) framework.

SematAcc latest version is always on-line at http://sematacc.meteor.com/. Just create your account (the simplest sign-up ever!) and use it as much as you want.

We are making it an open source and certainly invite those interested in continuing developing it further to join the excitement.
