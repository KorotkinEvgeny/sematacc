How to run Tests
================

As of July 2013, Meteor does not provide an official testing method. While this is understandable
(Meteor latest release is v0.6.4, indicating how it is still new and immature), 
testing is beneficial for the stability of a software.

[Laika](http://arunoda.github.io/laika/) is a project to create rich tests, which are able to emulate client/server
operability.
