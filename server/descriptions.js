  'opportunity': 'The set of circumstances that makes it appropriate to ' +
  'develop or change a software system. <br/> The opportunity articulates the' +
  'reason for the creation of the new, or changed, software system. It ' +
  'represents the team\'s shared understanding of the stakeholders\' needs, ' +
  'and helps shape the requirements for the new software system by providing ' +
  'justification for its development.',

  'stakeholders' : 'The people, groups, or organizations who affect or are ' +
  'affected by a software system. <br/> The stakeholders provide the ' +
  'opportunity and are the source of the requirements and funding for the ' +
  'software system. They must be involved throughout the software' +
  'engineering endeavor to support the team and ensure that an acceptable ' +
  'software system is produced.',

  'requirements': 'What the software system must do to address the ' +
  'opportunity and satisfy the stakeholders. <br/> It is important to ' +
  'discover what is needed from the software system, share this understanding ' +
  'among the stakeholders and the team members, and use it to drive the ' +
  'development and testing of the new system.',

 'software system': 'A system made up of software, hardware, and data that ' +
 'provides its primary value by the execution of the software. <br/>' +
 'The primary product of any software engineering endeavor, a software ' +
 'system can be part of a larger software, hardware or business solution.',

  'work': 'Activity involving mental or physical effort done in order to ' +
  'achieve a result. <br/> In the context of software engineering, work is ' +
  'everything that the team does to meet the goals of producing a software ' +
  'system matching the requirements, and addressing the opportunity, ' +
  'presented by the customer. The work is guided by the practices that make ' +
  'up the team\'s way-of-working.',

  'team': 'The group of people actively engaged in the development, ' +
  'maintenance, delivery and support of a specific software system. ' +
  'The team plans and performs the work needed to update and change ' +
  'the software system.',

  'way-of-working': 'The tailored set of practices and tools used by a team ' +
  'to guide and support their work. The team evolves their way of working ' +
  'alongside their understanding of their mission and their working ' +
  'environment. As their work proceeds they continually reflect on their ' +
  'way of working and adapt it as necessary to their current context.'
